	<h1>Workshop: Autonomous Space Robotics</h1>
	
<p>We are in the process of organising a workshop on Autonomous Space Robotics, to be held in-person on 24th April 2024, at the University of Manchester, UK. The workshop is supported by the Satellite Applications Catapult, the University of Manchester, and the Royal Academy of Engineering. </p>

<p>Our overall aim is to promote the transfer of knowledge and experience between those involved in the design, development and deployment of autonomous space robotics, to bring this community together, and to subsequently generate a position paper aimed at the diverse organisations involved in the use of Autonomous Systems in Space. This position paper would combine a view of the state-of-the-art together with the priority development areas for the future. </p>

<p>As part of this, we aim to have a selection of speakers, able to succinctly describe their work on specific issues around autonomous space robotics. </p>

<p>We only have small funds available and so are not able to fund either travel or subsistence. Registration is free.</p>
